#%% Make sizing field

# As we want to move the electrodes around inside the sensor, I thought the easiest thing would
# be to refine the mesh along the entire inner surface, that way we dont have to remesh if we move the 
# electrodes

# todo - define the line in the cad model
# could use the MathEval option too?
